# email

Email setup: [ortie](https://github.com/pimalaya/ortie) OAuth tokens, kept in the Secret Service keyring, shared by mail clients. The [himalaya](https://github.com/pimalaya/himalaya) CLI, used by agents and scripts, reaches Gmail and Outlook over IMAP. The agent-side usage lives in the `email` skill (`packages/agents/files/agents/skills/email/`).

For reading by hand, use the Gmail and Outlook web apps from the `browser` package.

Linux only for now (`groups/apps/linux.toml`): token storage uses `secret-tool`.

## Private addresses

This repo is public, so addresses live in the dotman local override `~/.config/dotman/repos/main/local.toml`:

```toml
[vars.email.gmail]
address = "you@gmail.com"

[vars.email.outlook]
address = "you@outlook.com"
```

Without them the templates fail to render and the push stops.

## First sign-in

After `dotman push`, authorize each account once:

```sh
ortie auth get -a gmail
ortie auth get -a outlook
```

Both finish on their own: the browser returns to ortie's listener on `http://127.0.0.1:<random port>`.
If ortie cannot capture the redirect, it prints an `ortie auth resume --state=... --pkce=... <REDIRECTED_URI>` command instead. Run it with `-a <account>` added (the printed command omits the account) and the browser's failed redirect URL, single-quoted.

Check with `himalaya envelope list -a gmail` and `-a outlook`.

## Sending switch

Each account can send by default. To make a machine drafts-only, override in `local.toml`:

```toml
[vars.email.outlook]
send = false
```

himalaya then drops that account's `smtp` section, so `message send` fails. Both tokens always carry send rights (Gmail has no send-free scope, and Outlook's is granted up front), so toggling needs no new sign-in.

Agents with shell access can still use the stored token directly; the switch prevents mistakes, not a determined attacker.
